Make sure your MySQL server has a database and tables as follows:

- **Database:** `jaykamavisdar`
- **Tables:**
- `libimport` (`book_name`, `author`, `quantity`, `date_of_arrival`)
- `libstocks` (`book_id`, `book_name`, `author`, `shelf_no`)
- `libdemands` (`book_name`, `author`, `quantity`)
- `taken_by_student` (`reg_no`, `student_name`, `date_of_taking`, `book_id`)
- `return_by_student` (`reg_no`, `student_name`, `date_of_return`, `book_id`)

*Field types and constraints should match your application logic.*

Set the `user`, `passwd`, and `database` fields to your own MySQL settings.
